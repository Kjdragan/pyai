## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)
```python
# Existing code continues to work
result = await process_report_request(data, "comprehensive")
```

### Advanced Usage (New Intelligent System)
```python
# Create universal data container
universal_data = UniversalReportData(
    query="Latest AI developments and market implications",
    research_data=research_results,
    youtube_data=video_transcript
)

# Generate intelligent report
result = await process_intelligent_report_request(
    universal_data=universal_data,
    style="comprehensive", 
    quality_level="premium"
)
```

### Orchestrator Integration
```python
# Automatic intelligent report generation
await dispatch_to_intelligent_report_writer(
    ctx, 
    query="AI technology market analysis", 
    style="executive",
    quality_level="premium"
)
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Model Selection**: Automatic selection of appropriate LLM based on complexity
2. **Content Prioritization**: Intelligent ranking of research results by relevance and quality
3. **Transcript Optimization**: Smart extraction of key segments from long video content
4. **Caching Strategy**: Result caching to prevent duplicate processing
5. **Single-Pass Generation**: Optimized generation flow for standard quality reports
