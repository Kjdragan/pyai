# MCP Evaluation Report: Context7 vs Pydantic Logfire MCP

## Executive Summary
- Both Context7 and the dedicated Pydantic Logfire MCP effectively return the Logfire docs we need (Query API, SQL reference, Live View NL→SQL).
- Preference: use the dedicated, domain-specific MCP first for precision and speed; use Context7 for broader cross-source discovery and comparisons.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Coverage of Logfire topics.
- Precision vs noise.
- Speed/ergonomics.
- Suitability for PRD/implementation planning.
- Cross-source breadth beyond Logfire.

## Findings
- Context7 MCP
  - Strengths:
    - Resolved `/pydantic/logfire` and returned high-signal docs.
    - Covered Query API (endpoint, auth, formats, params), SQL reference (tables, JSON ops), Live View NL→SQL (Pydantic AI powered).
    - Good for widening scope (adjacent libraries, cross-comparisons).
  - Limitations:
    - General-purpose; may require tighter prompts to match the domain MCP’s precision.

- Pydantic Logfire MCP (dedicated)
  - Strengths:
    - Highly targeted to Logfire; consistently precise hits.
    - Fastest path to key answers (Query API usage, SQL operators, NL→SQL is UI-only).
  - Limitations:
    - Narrow scope when you need to branch into related ecosystems.

## Pros and Cons

- Context7 MCP
  - Pros:
    - Broad cross-source coverage.
    - Effective at retrieving Logfire docs plus adjacent topics when needed.
  - Cons:
    - Slightly more generalized; precision can be lower unless queries are focused.

- Pydantic Logfire MCP
  - Pros:
    - Best precision and speed for Logfire-specific questions.
  - Cons:
    - Less useful for cross-library comparisons.

## Preferences and Usage Guidance
- Default flow for framework/repo research:
  1) Prefer dedicated, domain-specific MCPs (framework/library specific) for precise, fast retrieval of docs and examples.
  2) Use Context7 MCP when broader cross-source coverage or comparisons are needed.
  3) Start with the dedicated MCP; use Context7 for breadth and cross-checking.

- Applied to our Logfire task:
  - NL→SQL: UI feature powered by Pydantic AI; no public external NL→SQL API documented.
  - Query execution: Use `/v1/query` with read token; JSON/Arrow/CSV supported; sync/async clients exist.
  - SQL dialect: DataFusion/Postgres-like with JSON operators and helpful templates.

## Risks/Limitations
- NL→SQL externalization: We’ll bring our own LLM in Streamlit, add guardrails (schema-aware prompts, time windows).
- Auth handling: Securely manage read tokens.
- JSON columns: Arrow/CSV responses serialize nested JSON—handle carefully in DataFrames.

## Conclusion
- For Logfire-centric work: Pydantic Logfire MCP first.
- For broader research/comparisons: Context7 MCP as a strong complement.
